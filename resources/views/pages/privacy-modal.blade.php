                    The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites<br>
                    collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information<br>

                    Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.<br>
                    You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.<br>
                    <b>12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b><br>

                    You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.<br>
                    If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.<br>
